**Printing in Color in Python**

Printing in color can be very obnoxious when done excessively, but done sparingly it can be helpful sometimes to highlight text output in your program.

The basic way to do this in python (without help from external libraries) is not very straightforward, but it can be done.

Go to this page and read up on how to do it:

For your bonus lab, write a program that prints out 10 lines, each line with a different combination of background color, foreground color and effects.

Later in the class we will learn how to import external libraries that will make this code easier to write!
